Sudoku
======

In this demo we take the well-known game of Sudoku, and demonstrate how developers can use HTML5 and JavaScript to create an efficient algorithm to solve these puzzles. The algorithms draw heavily on the Chakra engineâ€™s support for ECMAScript 5 standard array operations to rapidly solve many Sudoku games. You can also manually solve Sudoku puzzles.
